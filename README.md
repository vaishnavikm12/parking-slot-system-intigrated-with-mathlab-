# parking-slot-system-intigrated-with-mathlab-
 This work presents a hardware-based intelligent parking system integrated with  MATLAB for automated slot detection, vehicle management, and digital payment.  The setup uses ultrasonic sensors for slot monitoring, IR sensors for entry/exit  detection, servo motors for gate control, and an Arduino Uno for coordination.
